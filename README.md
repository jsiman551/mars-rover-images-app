## App Description:

Connects to the NASA API (NASA Open APIs)

### Main goals:

- [x] Obtains photos from the 'Mars Rover' endpoint.
- [x] Allows the user to see the photos of each rover (Curiosity, Opportunity and Spirit).
- [x] The photos list should be paginated showing a max of 25 photos per page (dynamic loading similar to facebook/instagram will be nice, but not required).
- [x] Allows the user to filter the rover photos by camera.
- [x] By default it shows the latest photos for current day.
- [x] Allows the user to search for photos based on 'Earth Day' date (2020-09-22).
- [x] Allows the user to search for photos based on the 'Sol' date (2890).

### Optional goals:

- [ ] Let the user store search parameters as favorites or bookmarks that can be recalled in the future (Local storage is accepted, any serverless way of storing data is also accepted).
- [ ] A lot of extra points if you include a few tests.
- [x] You can (and will get extra points) use NextJS to develop your app.
